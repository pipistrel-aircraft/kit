                                    aeronautic.&nbsp; She even likes flying with me, so I guess I'm pretty lucky compared to many who share this particular addiction.<br
                                    /><br />My home town is Dayton, Ohio, where my grandmother lived in the same neighborhood as the Wright Brothers when she
                                    was a little girl, and she knew the Wright family.&nbsp; My father was an engineer at what was then known as Wright Field
                                    (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), and among other things led early work on the first US ejection seat at the end of WWII.&nbsp;
                                    I remember clearly when I was perhaps four or five years old, my dad built a small blue and yellow free flight model, and
                                    flew it over the corn fields of my grandfather's farm.&nbsp; The sight and sound of that model climbing up and up into the
                                    blue summer sky until the engine quit, then drifting away in lazy circles, remains with me to this day.&nbsp; I suppose that's
                                    where it all started.<br /><br />I built models of all types while I was growing up, though most were rubber powered.&nbsp;
                                    We didn't have a lot of money,&nbsp;and my small allowance wouldn't purchase more than a couple of glow-ignition engines over
                                    the years.&nbsp; So, it was gliders and rubber-powered models, plastic kits, a few .049-size control line types, one Wakefield,
                                    even a try at crude indoor models (covered with condenser paper and flown outdoors on calm days).&nbsp; Later, my dad bought
                                    one of the early single-channel radio control systems and put it in a small rudder-only plane that we used to fly at the local
                                    park when I was in high school.&nbsp; <br /><br />I studied electrical engineering at the University of Cincinnati, which
                                    was (and still is) a co-op university.&nbsp; That is, we worked for a quarter and went to school&nbsp;for a quarter, alternating
                                    work and study&nbsp;on a five-year degree program that&nbsp;gave&nbsp;me enough income to pay for school,&nbsp;buy a car and
                                    get a&nbsp;private pilot's license.&nbsp; Sadly, at today's university costs, that scenario is no longer possible. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When
                                    I graduated, we were in the midst of the Viet Nam&nbsp;War, so I signed&nbsp;up to join the Navy while I was in my senior
                                    year.&nbsp; After graduation, it was off to Pensacola for Aviation Officers' Candidate School.&nbsp; My eyesight was just
                                    outside the tolerance to be a Navy pilot at the time, so I became a Naval Flight Officer and flew as a Tactical Coordinator
                                    in P-3 Orions.&nbsp;&nbsp;After one active duty tour, with a wife and small child, I&nbsp;decided to leave&nbsp;active duty
                                    and went to work for Electronic Data Systems, back when it was still majority-owned by Ross Perot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross Perot's
                                    public image suffered a bit under the media scrutiny of a presidential campaign, but he was probably the most inspirational
                                    single individual I've ever met, and I'll let it go at that.&nbsp; <br /><br />After seven years at EDS and ten or twelve
                                    relocations, we decided to look for something more stable, and I found a job with Boeing in the Seattle area.&nbsp; I stayed
                                    in the Naval Reserve throughout, eventually becoming C.O. of P-3 squadron VP-69 at NAS Whidbey Island.&nbsp; I'm now retired
                                    from both the Naval Reserve and Boeing, but have returned to Boeing as a contract employee.&nbsp; My Boeing career has been
                                    centered on maritime patrol aircraft systems and software development, including nearly eight years in the United Kingdom
                                    working on the Nimrod MRA4 aircraft project, and have been working on the P-8A program at Boeing since 2005.&nbsp; The P-8A
                                    is based on the Boeing 737 airframe, became operational with the US Navy in 2013, and is now well on the way to replacement
                                    of the aging P-3 fleet.<br /><br />My personal flying activity has included the acquisition of commercial, instrument, multi-engine,
                                    instructor and instrument instructor ratings with my GI Bill benefits during the first few years after my active duty tour.&nbsp;
                                    Later I added a commercial glider rating, and most of my flying for the past several years has been in gliders.&nbsp;<br /><br
                                    />I think gliding makes flying a truly enjoyable and affordable sporting pastime.&nbsp; After an hour of boring holes in the
                                    sky or shooting touch and goes in a power aircraft (and thinking about how much money you are spending), power flying gets
                                    boring pretty quickly if you aren't going somewhere or seeing something new.&nbsp; In a glider, however, you can launch at
                                    noon, stay up for four or five hours and never leave sight of the home airport, but the whole time can be fun and simulating.&nbsp;
                                    There's just something about watching that altimeter needle climb with no engine pulling you up, accompanied by the constant
                                    mental challenge of working the current lift&nbsp;while&nbsp;thinking about finding the next patch, that keeps you on your
                                    toes and provides a real sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />Building my own&nbsp;full-size aircraft has been a personal goal
                                    for forty years or so.&nbsp; I joined EAA while I was in college and acquired some early&nbsp;homebuilt aircraft&nbsp;information
                                    packets, back when&nbsp;all you could get were rolled drawings and little else from the designer.&nbsp; It was then up to
                                    you to figure out where to buy materials and acquire the necessary building skills.&nbsp; As for most people who aspire to
                                    build a homebuilt&nbsp;aircraft, career, family and home intervened for a long time, but eventually I bought a set of Skybolt
                                    plans in 1972 and started cutting and welding steel tubing.&nbsp; Progress was slow to stopped for a few years and I carted
                                    the fuselage side frames through three house moves before eventually deciding that a two-place open cockpit biplane just wasn't
                                    practical for me and my family.&nbsp; I sold the Skybolt project and bought a BD-4 kit that had been partially completed by
                                    a high school shop class.&nbsp; Before I got very far on that effort, however, I decided that I just wasn't happy with the
                                    workmanship that had preceded mine, so I sold that one, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Meanwhile, Burt Rutan had sprung the Varieze
                                    and LongEZ on the homebuilt community, then Nat Puffer came up with the 3-place Cozy.&nbsp; I bought a set of plans for that
                                    airplane, but between a demanding job at Boeing and a second career in the Naval Reserve, there just wasn't time to commence
                                    construction.&nbsp; Nat also began work on a 4-place version, then announced that he was going to offer plans.&nbsp; I bought
                                    one of the first sets of plans for the Cozy MKIV, but they languished until my retirement from the Naval Reserve in 1995 gave
                                    me some free time.&nbsp; I started the Cozy in 1996 and made reasonably steady progress for a few years, during which our
                                    kids grew up and moved away, so the need diminished greatly for a 4-place 200 mph cross country aircraft that was going to
                                    take me another five years to complete.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, that's why I'm building this particular aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;My
                                    objectives have changed and I'm turning the Cozy project over to my son to complete.&nbsp; The Cozy is scratch-built except
                                    for a few prefab metal bits and pieces, and with over 2,000 hours invested in that project so far, I figure I'm about half
                                    done, even though the airframe is nearly complete.&nbsp; The Pipistrel, however, is a much more highly prefabricated kit,
                                    which you can see for yourself by looking at the kit build manual on the Pipistrel web sites.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still enjoy
                                    model aircraft -- mostly&nbsp;radio control&nbsp;in recent years, and lately electric-powered versions.&nbsp; They are quiet,
                                    clean, and the weight and power density of the battery-motor combinations is now equivalent to glow engines.&nbsp; The advances
                                    in battery chemistry now available on a small scale make me optimistic about the near-term potential for an economically viable
                                    move away from petroleum as the basis for daily personal transportation.&nbsp; Since I first wrote this biography, Pipistrel
                                    has done some very impressive work in the electric flight arena, including winning a 1.35 million dollar CAFE-Google Green
                                    Flight Challenge prize in 2011 with the Taurus G4 electric aircraft, achieving a truly outstanding 403 passenger-miles per
                                    equivalent gallon of gasoline while flying 200 miles at over 100 miles per hour.&nbsp; More recently, Pipistrel has developed
                                    and now offers the Alpha Electric trainer, with performance exceeding the Rotax-powered version for an endurance of one hour
                                    with 30-minute reserve.&nbsp; That's very impressive progress in only a few years, although getting to truly practical electric
                                    flight will require significant further advances in energy storage, which is another whole discussion....&nbsp; <br /><br
                                    />I initially figured that I could possibly get my Pipistrel done in time to fly it to Oshkosh Airventure 2007, but that was
                                    optimistic in light of other things that I need to spend my time on, such as building the house and attached hangar where
                                    we now live.&nbsp; I tell people that if I were building a second Pipistrel kit, working on it full time and taking advantage
                                    of everything I'm learning on this one, that I could get it done in a month, and I still think that's realistic.&nbsp; But
                                    few people build more than one aircraft, and fewer still build the same type aircraft more than once.&nbsp; Most will find,
                                    as I have, that the kit is very complete and very high quality, but it takes time to study, understand and complete all the
                                    construction tasks the first time around.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;six to twelve&nbsp;months of construction time is a reasonable
                                    estimate --&nbsp;more than that if you don't keep at it steadily, and less if you have nothing else to do with your time.<!--"''"--></div></font>
